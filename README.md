Software for UB's PHY410 class


This software package is to demonstrate the example code in the
UB Computational Physics class, PHY 410. 

The examples are typically provided in both python and C++ with
a few exceptions. These have been tested with python 2.7.2 and 
with GCC 4.7.3_0. 

The examples include several instances where matplotlib is used. 
There are also hooks (commented out) to use gnuplot. To get
started with these, try these links :
